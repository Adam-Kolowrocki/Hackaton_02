This is my Second hackaton task.

My project is to write a script to play "Hangman" game.
Used functions to make the code as clear as possible.
I had made three lists of words in, user can choose a category, the module random/choice pick a word for player.
Program is asking player for a letter or whole word if he knows it, check if the word given by player
is equal with chosen word - if so - player wins, if not - game is going on.
If player gives a letter, program checks if it was given before, if it in the chosen word and returns
info and prints parts of hangman if it is needed.
If player guess the word before 12 round, he wins...
If not... he HANGS...
